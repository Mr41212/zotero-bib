  abstract = {The Boltzmann equation or Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) describes the statistical behaviour of a thermodynamic system not in a state of equilibrium; it was devised by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872. The classic example of such a system is a fluid with temperature gradients in space causing heat to flow from hotter regions to colder ones, by the random but biased transport of the particles making up that fluid. In the modern literature the term Boltzmann equation is often used in a more general sense, referring to any kinetic equation that describes the change of a macroscopic quantity in a thermodynamic system, such as energy, charge or particle number. The equation arises not by analyzing the individual positions and momenta of each particle in the fluid but rather by considering a probability distribution for the position and momentum of a typical particle---that is, the probability that the particle occupies a given very small region of space (mathematically the volume element                                    d                        3                                        r                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle d{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} \}    ) centered at the position                                    r                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} \}    , and has momentum nearly equal to a given momentum vector                                    p                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}mathbf \{p\} \}     (thus occupying a very small region of momentum space                                    d                        3                                        p                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle d{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}mathbf \{p\} \}    ), at an instant of time. The Boltzmann equation can be used to determine how physical quantities change, such as heat energy and momentum, when a fluid is in transport. One may also derive other properties characteristic to fluids such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity (by treating the charge carriers in a material as a gas). See also convection--diffusion equation. The equation is a nonlinear integro-differential equation, and the unknown function in the equation is a probability density function in six-dimensional space of a particle position and momentum. The problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions is still not fully resolved, but some recent results are quite promising.},

  abstract = {There are two forms of power generation based on nuclear reactions: nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, but only the former has been deployed commercially. A nuclear fission reactor harnesses a nuclear chain reaction, normally involving uranium-238. There are a variety of different fusion reactors in use, including boiling water reactors, pressurized water reactors, and gas-cooled reactors. As well as these conventional reactors there have been attempts to develop fast or breeder reactors that can generate their own reactor fuel as well as energy. All the major reactor manufacturers have developed third-generation reactors that are designed to be safer than those operating today. However, nuclear power remains a controversial source of electric power because of the potential danger in case of an accidental release of radioactive material. There is, moreover, no generally accepted means of disposing of nuclear waste and this is a growing problem across the world.},

  abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or fine mesh applications as pin by pin neutron flux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a finite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly configurations.},

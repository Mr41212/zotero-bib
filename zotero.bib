  abstract = {Significance             While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms.           ,              Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias--variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias--variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias--variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

A nuclear fission reactor harnesses a nuclear chain reaction, normally involving uranium-238. There are a variety of different fusion reactors in use, including boiling water reactors, pressurized water reactors, and gas-cooled reactors. As well as these conventional reactors there have been attempts to develop fast or breeder reactors that can generate their own reactor fuel as well as energy. All the major reactor manufacturers have developed third-generation reactors that are designed to be safer than those operating today. However, nuclear power remains a controversial source of electric power because of the potential danger in case of an accidental release of radioactive material. There is, moreover, no generally accepted means of disposing of nuclear waste and this is a growing problem across the world.},

  abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or fine mesh applications as pin by pin neutron flux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a finite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly configurations.},

  abstract = {Reactor core transient calculation is very important for the reactor safety analysis, in which the kernel is neutron kinetics calculation by simulating the variation of neutron density or thermal power over time. Compared with the point kinetics method, the time-space neutron kinetics calculation can provide accurate variation of neutron density in both space and time domain. But it consumes a lot of resources. It is necessary to develop a surrogate model that can quickly obtain the temporal and spatial variation information of neutron density or power with acceptable calculation accuracy. This paper uses the time-varying characteristics of power to construct a time function, parameterizes the time-varying characteristics which contains the information about the spatial change of power. Thereby, the amount of targets to predict in the space domain is compressed. A surrogate method using the machine learning is proposed in this paper. In the construction of a neural network, the input is processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a fully connected layer or a deconvolution layer. For the problem of time sequence disturbance, a structure combining convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network is used. It is verified in the tests of a series of 1D, 2D and 3D reactor models. The predicted values obtained using the constructed neural network models in these tests are in good agreement with the reference values, showing the powerful potential of the surrogate models.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the theoretical and practical application of the finite element method to the neutron transport equation. The theoretical examination which is applicable to the general transport equation in arbitrary geometry includes a derivation of the equivalent integral law (or weak form) of the first order neutron transport equation, to which the finite element method (Galerkin approach) is applied, resulting in a system of algebraic equations. We show that in principle the system of equations can be solved with certain physical restrictions concerning the criticality of the medium. The convergence of this approximate solution to the exact solution with mesh refinement is examined, and a non-optimal estimate of the convergence rate is obtained analytically. It is noted that the numerical results indicate a faster convergence rate and several approaches to obtain this result analytically are outlined. The practical application of the finite element method involved the development of a computer code capable of solving the neutron transport equation in l-D plane geometry. Vacuum, reflecting, or specified incoming boundary conditions may be analyzed, and all are treated as natural boundary conditions. The incorporation of the reflecting boundary conditions is seen to result in an ambiguity, which must be resolved by consideration of the direction in which neutrons travel. Discontinuous phase space finite elements are introduced, and it is seen that discontinuous angular elements effectively match the analytical discontinuities in the angular flux at mu = 0 for plane geometry. In addition, the use of discontinuous spatial elements is shown to result in treating continuity of the angular flux at an interface as-a natural interface condition in the direction of neutron travel. The time-dependent transport. equation is also examined and it is shown that the application of the finite element method in conjunction . with the Crank-Nicholson time discretization method results in a system of algebraic equations which is readily solved. Numerical results are given for several critical slab eigenvalue problems, including anisotropic scattering, and the results compare extremely well with benchmark results. It is seen that the finite element code is more efficient than a standard discrete ordinates code for certain problems. Precise numerical tests are made on the convergence rate of the approximate solution (L2 norm) with mesh refinement and also with the eigenvalue error. These results indicate O[h{\textasciicircum}(k+l )] solution error in the L2 norm and O(h 2k+l ) error in the eigenvalue, where h is the mesh spacing and k the degree of the finite element. A problem with severe heterogeneities is considered and it is shown that the use of discontinuous spatial and angular elements results in a marked improvement in the results. Finally, time-dependent problems are examined and it is seen that the phenomenon of angular mode separation makes the numerical treatment of the transport equation "in slab geometry a considerable challenge, with the result that the angular mesh has a dominant effect on obtaining acceptable solutions to the time-dependent  transport equation.},

Reduced-order modeling relies on finding suitable basis functions which define a low-dimensional space in which a high-dimensional system is approximated.

Autoencoders provide a nonlinear alternative to POD/SVD, that may capture, more efficiently, features or patterns in the high-fidelity model results. Reduced-order models based on an autoencoder and a novel hybrid SVD-autoencoder are developed.

To improve this condition, this work develops a set of reduced-order models for the NTE (NTEROM) by combining the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the Galerkin projection techniques to efficiently solve the neutron transport problems. Results of some typical benchmarks show that the proposed POD based NTEROM can estimate the neutron transport behaviors with high fidelity and outstanding computing efficiency. Furthermore, the prediction function of the proposed NTEROMs can be extended to approximately calculate the neutron transport problems with the parameters outside of the snapshots' parameter range. This work can provide new perspectives and ideas on the issue of improving the efficiency of numerical calculations in nuclear reactor engineering.},

  abstract = {Augmenting neural networks with skip connections, as introduced in the so-called ResNet architecture, surprised the community by enabling the training of networks of more than 1,000 layers with significant performance gains. This paper deciphers ResNet by analyzing the effect of skip connections, and puts forward new theoretical results on the advantages of identity skip connections in neural networks. We prove that the skip connections in the residual blocks facilitate preserving the norm of the gradient, and lead to stable back-propagation, which is desirable from optimization perspective. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, as more residual blocks are stacked, the norm-preservation of the network is enhanced. Our theoretical arguments are supported by extensive empirical evidence. Can we push for extra norm-preservation? We answer this question by proposing an efficient method to regularize the singular values of the convolution operator and making the ResNet's transition layers extra norm-preserving. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the learning dynamics and the classification performance of ResNet can be improved by making it even more norm preserving. Our results and the introduced modification for ResNet, referred to as Procrustes ResNets, can be used as a guide for training deeper networks and can also inspire new deeper architectures.},

  abstract = {Reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been widely used to analyze stationary flows. Neural networks such as autoencoders are effective to reduce the dimension of non-stationary flow, but their larger storage requirements compared to POD and DMD compromise the expectations on ROM. The present work aims at compressing the autoencoder model via two distinctively different approaches, i.e., pruning and singular value decomposition (SVD). The developed algorithm is then applied to reconstruct the flow fields of typical stationary (i.e., a laminar cylinder flow and two turbulent channel flows) and non-stationary (i.e., a laminar co-rotating vortex pair) examples. It is shown that pruning and SVD reduce the size of the autoencoder network to 6\% and 3\% for the two simple laminar cases (or 18\% and 13\%, 20\%, and 10\% for the two complex turbulent channel flow cases), respectively, with approximately the same order of accuracy. Therefore, the proposed autoencoders optimized by the network pruning and SVD lead to effective ROM of both stationary and non-stationary flows although they require more iterations to converge than conventional methods.},

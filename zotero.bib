  abstract = {Significance             While breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms.           ,              Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias--variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias--variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This ``double-descent'' curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias--variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

  abstract = {The Boltzmann equation or Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) describes the statistical behaviour of a thermodynamic system not in a state of equilibrium; it was devised by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872. The classic example of such a system is a fluid with temperature gradients in space causing heat to flow from hotter regions to colder ones, by the random but biased transport of the particles making up that fluid. In the modern literature the term Boltzmann equation is often used in a more general sense, referring to any kinetic equation that describes the change of a macroscopic quantity in a thermodynamic system, such as energy, charge or particle number. The equation arises not by analyzing the individual positions and momenta of each particle in the fluid but rather by considering a probability distribution for the position and momentum of a typical particle---that is, the probability that the particle occupies a given very small region of space (mathematically the volume element                                    d                        3                                        r                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle d{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} \}    ) centered at the position                                    r                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}mathbf \{r\} \}    , and has momentum nearly equal to a given momentum vector                                    p                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle {\textbackslash}mathbf \{p\} \}     (thus occupying a very small region of momentum space                                    d                        3                                        p                          \{{\textbackslash}displaystyle d{\textasciicircum}\{3\}{\textbackslash}mathbf \{p\} \}    ), at an instant of time. The Boltzmann equation can be used to determine how physical quantities change, such as heat energy and momentum, when a fluid is in transport. One may also derive other properties characteristic to fluids such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity (by treating the charge carriers in a material as a gas). See also convection--diffusion equation. The equation is a nonlinear integro-differential equation, and the unknown function in the equation is a probability density function in six-dimensional space of a particle position and momentum. The problem of existence and uniqueness of solutions is still not fully resolved, but some recent results are quite promising.},

  abstract = {There are two forms of power generation based on nuclear reactions: nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, but only the former has been deployed commercially. A nuclear fission reactor harnesses a nuclear chain reaction, normally involving uranium-238. There are a variety of different fusion reactors in use, including boiling water reactors, pressurized water reactors, and gas-cooled reactors. As well as these conventional reactors there have been attempts to develop fast or breeder reactors that can generate their own reactor fuel as well as energy. All the major reactor manufacturers have developed third-generation reactors that are designed to be safer than those operating today. However, nuclear power remains a controversial source of electric power because of the potential danger in case of an accidental release of radioactive material. There is, moreover, no generally accepted means of disposing of nuclear waste and this is a growing problem across the world.},

  abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or fine mesh applications as pin by pin neutron flux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a finite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly configurations.},

  abstract = {Reactor core transient calculation is very important for the reactor safety analysis, in which the kernel is neutron kinetics calculation by simulating the variation of neutron density or thermal power over time. Compared with the point kinetics method, the time-space neutron kinetics calculation can provide accurate variation of neutron density in both space and time domain. But it consumes a lot of resources. It is necessary to develop a surrogate model that can quickly obtain the temporal and spatial variation information of neutron density or power with acceptable calculation accuracy. This paper uses the time-varying characteristics of power to construct a time function, parameterizes the time-varying characteristics which contains the information about the spatial change of power. Thereby, the amount of targets to predict in the space domain is compressed. A surrogate method using the machine learning is proposed in this paper. In the construction of a neural network, the input is processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a fully connected layer or a deconvolution layer. For the problem of time sequence disturbance, a structure combining convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network is used. It is verified in the tests of a series of 1D, 2D and 3D reactor models. The predicted values obtained using the constructed neural network models in these tests are in good agreement with the reference values, showing the powerful potential of the surrogate models.},

  abstract = {Using an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction, this article presents a novel projection-based reduced-order model for eigenvalue problems. Reduced-order modeling relies on finding suitable basis functions which define a low-dimensional space in which a high-dimensional system is approximated. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are often used for this purpose and yield an optimal linear subspace. Autoencoders provide a nonlinear alternative to POD/SVD, that may capture, more efficiently, features or patterns in the high-fidelity model results. Reduced-order models based on an autoencoder and a novel hybrid SVD-autoencoder are developed. These methods are compared with the standard POD-Galerkin approach and are applied to two test cases taken from the field of nuclear reactor physics.},
